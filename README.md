##  Project Overview
The **Splice Playground Web App** is an interactive tool that helps users understand and experiment with JavaScript’s `splice()` method. Users can input parameters like start index, number of elements to delete, and new items to add. The app then modifies the array accordingly and displays both the updated array and any items removed.

Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**, this project illustrates real-time DOM updates, array manipulation, and user-driven interaction.

---

##  Features
- **Live Array Visualizer**: View the current state of the array in real time.
- **Control Inputs**:
  - **Start Index** — position where `splice()` begins.
  - **Delete Count** — number of items to remove.
  - **Add Items** — new elements to insert.
- **Immediate Feedback**:
  - Display the **updated array**.
  - Show the **removed elements** returned by `splice()`.
- **Educational Output**: Optionally show the exact `splice()` function call used.
- **Responsive UI** using **Bootstrap** to ensure usability across devices.

---

##  Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Page structure and form inputs.
- **CSS3 & Bootstrap** – Layout, styling, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Core logic, array manipulation, and DOM updates.

##  How to Run the App
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enter values for start index, delete count, and items to add.
4. Click the **Apply** button to execute `splice()` on the sample array.
5. Observe the **updated array** and **removed elements** displayed live.
6. Resize your browser window or view on different devices to test responsiveness.

##  Concepts Applied
- Understanding and using the JavaScript `splice()` method (`array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, ... )`) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- DOM manipulation and dynamic updates via JavaScript.
- Handling form inputs and events in a web app.
- Using Bootstrap to create a responsive layout.
